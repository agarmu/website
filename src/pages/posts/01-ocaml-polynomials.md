The idea of a single-variable [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) and its
associated operations of addition, multiplication, and evaluation are ideas which most are familiar
with from grade-school. In calculus courses, we are further introduced to the
idea of [differentiating](https://web.mit.edu/wwmath/calculus/differentiation/polynomials.html)
these polynomials. Of course, performing these operations is fairly easy when considering operations like
addition, subtraction
