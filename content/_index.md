I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Purdue University. I am interested in
learning more about algorithms and cryptography. I have researched under [Prof. Hemanta K. Maji](https://cs.purdue.edu/homes/hmaji) as an undergraduate research assistant; during Summer 2025 I receive funding from Purdue ([SURF](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Research/EURO/students/about-SURF)) to work with him.

I am currently looking for opportunities (Research/Industry) for Summer 2026 and beyond.
