I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Purdue University. I am interested in
learning more about _algorithms_ and _cryptography_. I have researched under [Prof. Hemanta K. Maji](https://cs.purdue.edu/homes/hmaji) as an undergraduate research assistant; during Summer 2025 I received funding from Purdue ([SURF](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Research/EURO/students/about-SURF)) to work with him.

I am currently looking for internship opportunities (Research or Industry) for Summer 2026 and beyond. Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or via email!
