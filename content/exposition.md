# Exposition

Here is a collection of informal writings, notes, and presentations I have created. Please note that these may contain errors or inaccuracies.

### Summer 2025
- {{<remotepdf "https://cs.purdue.edu/homes/agarw396/surf2025.pdf" "Embedding Schur Product into Prime-Field Multiplication">}}
    - A presentation I gave for the SURF program during Summer 2025, covering one of the problems I worked on with Prof. Maji.
- **[To Upload]** Shortest Path Algorithms
    - Some notes I wrote up on different shortest path algorithms for a reading group presentation, covering classic algorithms
      (Dijkstra, DP-based algorithms) as well as Min-Sum Product Based Algorithms, Seidel's Algorithm, and the Bernstein, Nanongkai, Wulff-Neilsen Shortest-Path algorithm from STOC 2022. <br>
      These notes have some major errors I have not fixed, so I have not uploaded them yet.

### Spring 2025
- {{<remotepdf "https://cs.purdue.edu/homes/agarw396/drp_dirichlet.pdf" "Dirichlet's Theorem on Primes in Arithmetic Progression">}}
    - These are presentation notes I prepared for a 15-minute presentation at the end of my [directed reading](https://sites.google.com/view/purdue-drp/) in Analytic Number Theory; the talk itself was given on a blackboard.
    
- {{<remotepdf "https://cs.purdue.edu/homes/agarw396/laplacian.pdf" "Fast Laplacian Solvers">}}
    - This is a short presentation I delivered on Laplacian Solvers for my undergraduate algorithms class, taught by [Prof. Kent Quanrud](https://kentquanrud.com/).
